ShareSocial addon for Kodi (XBMC) - social sharing for Kodi
-----------------------------------------------------------
Module that adds the ability to share media with social networking sites. Also includes a feed viewer with twitter built in and Facebook and Flickr via my other addons.

Installation should be done through Kodi System::Settings::Add-ons::Get Add-Ons::All Add-Ons::Program Add-Ons::Share Social

If you want to ensure you are using the latest version of the addon you can install my [repository .zip file](http://ruuks-repo.googlecode.com/files/ruuk.addon.repository-1.0.0.zip).

Installation of the repository should be done through Kodi System::Settings::Add-ons::Install from zip file
